# Checklist to improve on dataframe hygiene

* Have you checked and corrected for nulls / nans?
* Are column datatypes as expected / required?
* Have you checked for outliers in the columns?
* Have you checked for illegal values in the columns?
* Have you checked for structured values (i.e. dicts, lists, etc.) in the columns?
* Are dict values really dict values or actually JSON strings?
